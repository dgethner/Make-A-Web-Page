        After college, I decided to continue my career and personal development by perusing a project management certification.
        I signed up for a 5-Saturday course totaling 40 hours of instruction to obtain the knowledge needed to sit for the certification.
        After taking a few days off work to prepare for the exam, I sat for the 150 questions / 3-hour long exam. Once the exam was over,
        I received my score and learned that I had achieved my goal! I became a Certified Associate Project Manager. I have held this title since September 2016.
        I plan on sitting for my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification once I fulfill all the requirements to sit for the exam.

        After my initial pursuit into gaining an A+ certification and talking to my coworkers who are developers, I changed my path and wanted to learn development instead.
        I talked to a couple of friends who recommended Udacity as a good way for me to start learning about becoming a developer. The same night I reviewed Udacity's website
        I signed up for the Introduction to Programming course and started my adventure. I look forward to all the skills I learn from this nanodegree and I plan on continuing
        my education afterwards in the Full Stack nanodegree.
